# Proposal

## Motivation and Purpose:
The primary motivation behind the development of a dashboard app for "Household Expenditure and Income Surveys" is to provide easy access to valuable economic data about Iran's household expenditure and income. The purpose of this app is to help familiarize a wider audience, especially non-Iranian economic researchers with this valuable data set. The app aims to present the data in an intuitive and visually appealing way to help users better understand trends and patterns in the data.

## Description of the Data:
The "Household Expenditure and Income Surveys" is a valuable economic data set published every year by the "Statistical Centre of Iran". The survey collects data from a representative sample of Iranian households and covers various aspects of household expenditures and income, including food, clothing, housing, health, education, transportation, and more. The data set provides valuable insights into household behavior and spending patterns over time.

The Statistical Center of Iran has been conducting the Household Expenditure and Income Survey since 1963 in rural areas and since 1968 in urban areas. The survey provides estimates of income and expenditure for households at provincial and country levels, and enables researchers to analyze consumption patterns and poverty rates. The raw data has been published since 1984, and the author of the project aims to clean and explore the data in a reproducible way for researchers. The survey year is based on the Persian calendar and can be converted to the Gregorian calendar by adding 621 for dates before March 21 and 622 for dates after.

## Research Questions and Usage Scenarios:
A possible persona that could benefit from using this app is a research analyst working for an international organization that is interested in the Iranian economy. This analyst might want to explore how different expenditure categories have changed over time in Iran and compare them with other countries. The app can help answer questions such as:

- What are the major expenditure categories for Iranian households?
- How have household expenditures on different categories changed over time in Iran?
- How do household expenditures on different categories in Iran compare to other countries in the region?
- What is the distribution of household income in Iran, and how has it changed over time?

The app can also be useful for policymakers in Iran who need more reliable insight and data from the "Household Expenditures and Income Survey" to make informed decisions on issues related to the economy, poverty reduction, and social welfare. They might want to explore the following questions:

- What is the impact of government policies on household expenditures in different categories?
- How has income inequality changed over time in Iran?
- What are the determinants of household expenditure patterns in Iran?
