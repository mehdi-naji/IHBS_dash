## Introduction
Welcome to the "Iran Household Expenditure and Income Surveys" app! This app is designed to help you explore the "Household Expenditures and Income Survey" data published annually by the "Statistical Centre of Iran". The app provides intertemporal and intratemporal insights into household expenditures in Iran, and is a first step in a long-term project to promote the use of this valuable economic dataset.

## Purpose of the App
The main goal of this app is to introduce the "Household Expenditures and Income Survey" dataset to a wider audience, and to provide a quick and easy way to visualize the data. The app is intended for two main groups of users:

- Non-Iranian economic researchers and anyone interested in learning about Iran's economy.
- Iranian economists and researchers who need reliable data and insights from the "Household Expenditures and Income Survey".

## Deliverables
Currently, the app provides intertemporal and intratemporal plots based on the "Household Expenditures and Income Survey" data. Users can choose a year and see a bar plot and treemap plot for household expenditures in that year. Alternatively, users can choose an expenditure category and see how its expenditures have evolved over time. In the future, we plan to add more plots, tables, and features to the app, and to make the dataset itself available for download.

## Usage
To use the app, simply download the code from the Github repository and run it on your local machine. Make sure to install all the necessary dependencies as outlined in the requirements.txt file.

Once the app is running, you can access it in your web browser by navigating to the appropriate URL. The app will be split into two tabs: "Intertemporal Facts" and "Intratemporal Facts".

In the "Intratemporal Facts" tab, select a year from the dropdown menu to view the corresponding bar plot and treemap plot for household expenditures in Iran for that year. In the "Intertemporal Facts" tab, select an expenditure category and a decile to view a bar plot of how that category's expenditure has evolved over time.

The app also has a theme implemented using the dash_bootstrap_components library, which you can customize to suit your preferences.

Please note that this app is still a work in progress and may be updated with additional features and functionality in the future.

## Get Involved
We invite you to contribute to the "Iran Household Expenditure and Income Surveys" project in any way you can. Here are a few ways you can help:

- Share this app with your colleagues and friends who might be interested in the topic.
- Provide feedback on the app's functionality and user experience.
- Contribute to the codebase on GitHub to add new features or improve existing ones.

We hope that this app will be a useful tool for anyone interested in learning about household expenditures in Iran, and we look forward to your feedback and contributions. **Please note that this is just a first step in a long-term project, and there is much more to come!**
